This is my self-practice of core programming in the C language, where I have learned a wide range of concepts, including:

1: Fundamental Concepts: Variables, Data Types, Input/Output, Instructions, and Operators (Arithmetic, Logical, Relational, and Unary operators).
2: Conditional Statements: Understanding and applying if, if-else, and else statements.
3: Loop Control Statements: Mastering loops such as for, while, and do-while.
4: Functions and Recursion: Writing reusable code and understanding recursive logic.
5: Pointers: Working with memory addresses and dynamic referencing.
6: Arrays: Handling collections of data.
7: Strings: Manipulating sequences of characters.
8: Structures: Grouping related data into custom data types.
9: File I/O: Reading from and writing to files.
10: Dynamic Memory Allocation: Efficiently managing memory during program execution.

This journey has significantly strengthened my programming foundation in C.
